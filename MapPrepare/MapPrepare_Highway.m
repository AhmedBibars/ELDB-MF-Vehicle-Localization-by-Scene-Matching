%This file generateds two matrixes (PropagationMatrix,ImpactMatrix) for a
%specific "PropagationErrorCovariance". The generated matroxed used to
%conduct a fast propagation, using matrix multiplication, instead of 
%conductiong the propagation by convolute probalility vector with the 
%"PropagationErrorCovariance".
